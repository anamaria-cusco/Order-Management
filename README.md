## Requirements
Consider an application OrderManagement for processing client orders for a warehouse. Relational
databases are used to store the products, the clients and the orders. Furthermore, the application should
be structured in packages using a layered architecture and should use (minimally) the following
classes:
* Model classes - represent the data models of the application
* Business Logic classes - contain the application logic
* Presentation classes â€“ GUI related classes
* Data access classes - classes that contain the access to the database


## Description
This projects includes:
- Layered Architecture
- Database(MYSQL) App

In this project I learned how to use JavaDoc.
